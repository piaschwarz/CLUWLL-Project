(Kon)Text is a vocabulary learning web application for L1 speakers of German willing to practice
their knowledge of Italian as L2. The main goal of our app is to support vocabulary learning and
reinforcement through context sentences and word focus with Fill-in-the-blank exercises (FIBs).

The learning material provided by our app consists of 51 Italian texts, half of them of level B1 and
the other half of level B2. The ideal user of the app is a L1 speaker of German, studying Italian as
L2 at a level ranging from B1 to B2. We believe our app to be suitable for learners of different ages,
but not younger than 15/16 years old. Our system is most useful if used as an additional tool for
vocabulary learning and practice, either outside the classroom or during leisure time. Since our
app does not provide any theoretical information about grammar, we believe it to yield the best
results if combined with independent learning of grammatical rules - either in class or through the
consultation of a different educational resource.
