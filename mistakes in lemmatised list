The lemmatised list for B1 level is ready

What I fixed:


- wrong words which ended up in the lemmatised list (e.g. capitalised words, entities, names)
- non existent lemmas
- feminine version of masculine lemmas --> converted into masculine lemma ****** STILL NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK
- augmentative and diminutive suffixes were eliminated
- wrong POS: words with a POS different from noun, adj, adv or verb were put into stop words list
- when two alternative lemmas were found by the lemmatizer, i checked in the text for the right one
- typos and ortographic mistakes in the texts (hope I caught most of them)
- words with multiple possible POS (e.g. "quello" can be adj and pronoun): I kept them if one of the tags was a POS tag of a content word (noun, adj, verb, adv)
- the lemmatizer NEVER recognized reflexive verbs --> I hope I caught most of them, but need to double check

* What to do with foreign words which are, however, used often in Italian? (sms, film, e-mail)
* 


What still needs to be done:
- double check of the B1 lemmatised list
- lemmatised list for B2
- upload lexical lists from the CEFR for B1 and B2 level
- match words to lemmas by unique id (wanna do this for the future)
