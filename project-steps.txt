CLUWLL Steps:

- have useful context sentences for all Italian B1 and B2 lemmas available

- get translation of context sentences and word alignment

- populate SQL database -> think of useful formats for these tables:
	-> context sentences per lemma (and some sort of translation mapping?)
	-> vocab piles: Bootstrap pile (A1/A2 words with translation)
			All learned words (vocab the user has encountered anywhere in the app
			Most difficult words (n most difficult words for user)
			Most frequent Italian words (n most freq. words from the pile of all learned words)

- think of architecture for frontend and backend (data structures + user interface)

- implement Java Servlets + Angular App





Making up for bad lemmatizer for lemmatized B1/B2 lists and to create file lemma-contextSentsIDlist:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marta's previous project: amico -> amica amici amixxx amixyz
lemma-contextSentsIDlist: amici: [145, 2698, 3688]

Found the word "amica" in the learner text -> check all inflections -> find one inflection in lemma-contextSentsIDlist
