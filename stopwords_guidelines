Since I was not happy with the list of stopwords provided by nltk for the Italian language, 
I decided to create my own list based on the word's POS tag.

What I condered to be STOPWORDS are the words with the following tags:

ABR    abbreviation
CON   conjunction
DET:def   definite article
DET:indef   indefinite article
LS    list symbol
NUM   numeral
PON   punctuation
PRE   preposition
PRE:det   preposition+article
SENT    sentence marker
SYM   symbol
FW    foreign word


I have DOUBTS whether to consider the following word tags stopwords or not:

INT   interjection    ?
NUM   numeral   ?
PRO   pronoun   ?




What I have so far in the LEMMAS:

NOM   noun
VER   verb


According to our definition of "stopword" I can also go through the CEFR lexical lists (A1, A2, B1, B2) and decide which words are to be kicked out 
and which not.
